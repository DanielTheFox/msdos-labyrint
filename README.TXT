MS-DOS Labyrinth  

This is Labyrinth, a simple MS-DOS game that runs even in the
Intel 8088! This game was originally based in the game Adventure
for the Atari 2600, but the programmer could not take enough
time for programming enemies. The game uses mosly semigraphics,
but some situations claim for CGA graphics so this game runs on
the Color Graphics Adapter.

ฏ WARNING!

As the game is made in 2017, you might find some problems running
it in NTVDM (the emulation program on Windows 32-bit), it won't
run in anything newer than Windows XP SP3 unless you get and install
DosBox. Even if you get a boot disk (either an actual floppy disk
or an USB flash drive) some newer LCD screens will not figure out what
does "CGA" mean and will jerk or say "Out of frequency range" or
something like that. Even worse, modern graphics card (mostly those
designed for gaming) may not have CGA support anymore and will not show
anything or lock the machine, or the graphics will fail and leak the
misfortune of colors where they should not be. Either get DosBox or
put that old computer you have into the life, and play those games
(including this one) your newer computer can't even dream on playing.

ฏ System requirements

CPU: Intel 8088 at 4.77 MHz, recommended a version or clone of it running
     a bit faster, like 8086 or 80286 at 6 MHz. 150 KB RAM free.
Graphics card: CGA or compatible. Some Hercules cards will work under
               emulation (either by software or hardware), but shades
               of gray only. You need a compatible monitor too, a 4:3
               LCD or any CRT are recommended.
Operating system: MS-DOS 3 or higher, any Windows 16-bit, any Windows 9x,
                  Windows NT up to XP, any OS if you have DosBox.
Other: Keyboard, PC speaker, any PC have these.

ฏ Controls

F1 = Pause menu
F2 = Game status
F12 = Restart game (you cannot use F12 if your keyboard still lacks this key)
Numeric keypad:
      Key 2: Down
      Key 4: Left
      Key 6: Right
      Key 8: Up

NOTE: Arrow keys do not work, only numeric keypad.

ฏ Troubleshooting

"The game freezes on start (before the logo)!"
Your computer might not have CGA compatible video card. This happened a
lot before 1983, but is happening again since 2016 as the new gaming
video cards aren't compatible anymore with CGA. Use DosBox or an older
computer, or get a CGA compatible card.

"There's a fatal error message when I save my data, even when I initialized
a name"
You (or someone else) set the .cit file or the entire disk to read-only
after creating a profile. Set the disk or file in .cit to read-write again.

"If I keep pressing a single movement key, the walls show garbage or get
clonned. It's just horrible."
The poor game is having a bad time running, the computer is just too slow
and the key stroke repeat is faster than the speed the game fills the screen.
Only happens in very slow systems, so you may want to use a 286 at 6 MHz
at least, or do not hold the key.
